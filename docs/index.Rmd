This page is intended to present the Spatial Individual Specialization Index (*SpatIS*) and the Spatis Individual Complementary Specialization Index (*SpatICS*). The two indices were created to assess individual specialization in the use of space by animals and are implemented within R. They are associated to the publication described below. 

We present here the documentation of the R functions for running *SpatIS* and *SpatICS* using tracking data of individuals. We also present examples on how the indices work - they are in fact Appendix of the paper by Kercher-Rogeri et al. (_in review_).
