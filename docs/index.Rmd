This page presents the Spatial Individual Specialization Index (*SpatIS*) and the Spatis Individual Complementary Specialization Index (*SpatICS*). The two indices were created to assess individual specialization in the use of space by animals and are implemented within R, with support of the packages `sp` and `adehabitatHR`.

We present here the documentation of the R functions for running *SpatIS* and *SpatICS* using tracking data of individuals. We also present examples on how the indices work. They are based on the appendices of the paper by Kercher-Rogeri et al. (_in review_). You may find a direct link to the source code in the Github repository in th panel above.
